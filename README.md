# Real Time Dynamic Shortest Path 

This is a command-line application for building, modifying, and querying an weighted graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm, with support for dynamic updates to shortest-path results. The program includes an interactive event loop for real-time graph manipulation.

---

## Features
- Add, remove, and update weighted edges in the graph  
- Query shortest-path distances and shortest routes using Dijkstra’s algorithm  
- Automatically recompute shortest paths when the graph changes  
- Simple, modular Python architecture  
- Interactive CLI for real-time experimentation
